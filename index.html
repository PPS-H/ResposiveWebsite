                    <p class="text1">Code Literacy: Why Coding Became Important</p>
                    <p class="text2">Coding and programming are all around us and will only get more all-pervasive in
                        the future.

                        For this reason, many are making the argument that learning to code, or at least have a basic
                        understanding of it, should become a common part of a child's education.

                        Here we explore why coding is important, what it is, and where you can learn it for yourself.
                        Coding and coding literacy can be argued to be one of the most important skills for current and
                        future generations to learn. Many have argued that it should form part of a national curriculum
                        on par with a native language, the sciences, and math.

                    <p class="text2 left-text2">If you are interested in learning coding (or programming), there are
                        plenty of free
                        resources you can use. From YouTube tutorials, blog posts, forums, stackoverflow (the best!) and
                        other resources you are in good hands.

                        Many universities also have free lecture series' you can make good use of. A large portion of
                        these also offers an official qualification for a small fee.But the best way is to just dive in.
                        Jumping in at the deep end is one of the best, and quickest, ways to learn anything including
                        coding and programming.

                    <p class="text2">As we have already seen, coding is the process of producing codes that allow humans
                        to communicate with machines. For example, from English to Javascript.

                        This tends to be one of the first stages of creating a piece of software like an application.
                        Coding is very important in the modern digital world and allows every electronic device you use
                        to work at some level.

                        Everything a machine does follows a set of instructions (programming) that is written in a code
                        that translates human instructions into this binary code. Every letter you read, each picture
                        displayed, etc has behind it a sequence of 1's and 0's that instruct the machine how to process
                        them in the machine's memory and do something the programmer wants it to do.

                        A complete set of lines of code behind, say, an image in this article is also generally called a
                        script.
